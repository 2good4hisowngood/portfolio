                        As an Azure Architect with a focus on security, I am currently working towards my Master's degree in Information Security and Assurance through Embry-Riddle. I am constantly seeking out new knowledge and opportunities to grow my skills.

                        One of my notable achievements is architecting an Azure hosted cloud platform template for enterprise software hosting legacy desktop apps and full stack solutions for government agencies. I utilized Azure Virtual Desktop to manage session hosts, availability, and scalability, with Disaster Recovery built into the deployment. I implemented deployments using Terraform, with over 150 resources ranging from VMs to configurations, backups, and DR failover configurations, optimizing storage and customizing deployments using a parameterized builder repository. I also ensured that state drift was accounted for through regular reapplications of the deployment to re-establish the desired state.

                        I utilized Packer to build the VM images for Terraform, ensuring that updates were current and adjustments to the base image were easy to make and distribute to clients without any availability impact. I also implemented PowerShell DSC pipelines to take raw .ps1 configuration files, compile, package, sign, audit, and publish Guest Configurations on commit to the repository. These configurations were audited and reapplied every 15 minutes if needed.

                        To further automate my infrastructure as code (IaC) processes, I utilized GitHub Actions and Octopus Deploy to implement GitOps with repo commits and pulls between branches, managing the deployment of resources through Validation and Staging environments before manual release pushes it to production. This quality assurance helps to mitigate the risk of unintentional incidents.
