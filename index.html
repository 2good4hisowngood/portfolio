                        I am a security-focused Azure Architect, have completed my Master's degree in Information
                        Security and Assurance at Embry-Riddle, and am constantly striving to learn even more to
                        perpetually refine and expand my skills.

                            Tasked with designing and implementing a managed cloud hosting platform for a complex
                            monolithic ERP application, whose previous deployment process required coordination between
                            several people, had poor or non-existent documentation, and a decoupled but dependent
                            configuration, I designed and built automation pipelines with terraform, packer, and
                            powershell to allow a single engineer to deploy all components seamlessly, reducing a
                            process that often times took weeks down to hours.

                <p>
                    As the key decision maker for all aspects in improving the CI/CD side of the business, I am
                    responsible for determining the scope and prioritization of tasks, while ensuring that all
                    activities are compliant with relevant regulations and industry standards (PCI). This requires a
                    deep understanding of technical requirements as well as business objectives, and the ability to
                    balance competing demands and identify areas for improvement. Whether it is developing and
                    implementing sales strategies, hiring and training staff, providing ongoing support to clients, or
                    developing automation solutions, I take a strategic approach to every task, leveraging my knowledge
                    and experience to drive results.

                <ul style="color:#888">
                    <li>Over the first two months, paid down six months of backlog tasks that had crippled the team's
                        agility and worked to get self-service solutions put in place, with documentation to enable
                        teams to resolve issues within teams rather than depending on the DevOps team to assist each
                        developer with each question they had about their team's products.</li>
                    <li>Build a foundation of resources and tooling to enable automated deployments across the
                        uncoordinated variety of environments and methods in use, in order to bring them into a
                        standardized, cohesive workflow.</li>
                    <li>Build and manage a high-performing team of engineers, providing ongoing mentorship and skill
                        development opportunities to promote personal and professional growth, while driving increased
                        productivity and operational efficiency. Manage 1:1s, optomize team tasks to individual
                        strengths, and pair team members for cross-training to improve individual skill gaps and
                        increase team cohesion.</li>
                    <li>Work with Dev teams to design and implement CI/CD pipelines to automate artifact
                        build/test/deployment through the SDLC eventually to client environments, expanding monthly
                        deployment windows to at will deployments.</li>
                    <li>Create copious documentation: Presentations to onboard solutions to Dev team workflows,
                        documentation to maintain, and learn more about their new tools. Write proposals for new work
                        efforts, including terraform, automated post deployment validation testing, as well as AI
                        efforts like outlined below.</li>
                    <li>Introduced NLP automation team to ChatGPT API functionality, along with other recent advances,
                        such as creating reports on possibilities with Vector Databases, data collection and fine-tuning
                        models for our needs, self-training systems (like Voyager), API focused models (like Gorilla),
                        building unit testing into the pipeline to validate changes and score effectiveness. By
                        combining store sales data, data about events like weather and promotions, operators could enjoy
                        new insights easily queriable through normal question and answering to derive valuable new

                        This temporarily shelved project is a GPT-4 API empowered Python Runbook I built to help explore
                        synthetically generating Starfinder adventures. I've built out a number of features and plan to
                        build it out to include image and map generation as well as generating out full chatbot
                        personalities to boot up into the scenario, enabling me to take on rich and complex characters
                        by getting suggested dialogue feedback to inform my responses. I'll be returning to this project
                        once I have a pipeline to easily create fine-tunings for this purpose.
