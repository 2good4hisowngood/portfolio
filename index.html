                    <p>
                        I am a security-focused Azure Architect, have completed my Master's degree in Information Security and Assurance at Embry-Riddle, and am constantly striving to learn even more to perpetually refine and expand my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below are some highlights of my work achievements and responsibilities:
                    </p>

                        <li style="text-align: left">
                            Tasked with designing and implementing a managed cloud hosting platform for a complex monolithic ERP application, whose previous deployment process required coordination between several people, had poor or non-existent documentation, and a decoupled but dependent configuration, I designed and built automation pipelines with terraform, packer, and powershell to allow a single engineer to deploy all components seamlessly, reducing a process that often times took weeks down to hours.
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: left">
                            Successfully achieved and maintained NIST 800-53 compliance by designing and implementing security controls into the infrastructure as code, ensuring that all controls were enforced at the moment of deployment.
                        </li>

                            Oversaw a cloud engineering team, including recruitment, project management, professional development, and performance reviews, to ensure successful execution of projects and growth of team members.

                            Contributed to company's market growth and revenue by helping secure US State and City Government software contracts through writing and participating in sales pitches and demos, developing pricing strategies and custom platform improvements to meet specific client needs.
                        </li>
                        <!-- <li>Optimizing storage and customizing deployments using a parameterized builder repository, and ensuring state drift is accounted for through regular reapplications of the deployment to re-establish the desired state.</li>
                        <li>Using Packer to build VM images for Terraform, ensuring that updates are current and adjustments to the base image are easy to make and distribute to clients without any availability impact.</li>
                        <li>Implementing PowerShell DSC pipelines to take raw .ps1 configuration files, compile, package, sign, audit, and publish Guest Configurations on commit to the repository. These configurations are audited and reapplied every 15 minutes if needed.</li>
                        <li>Utilizing GitHub Actions and Octopus Deploy to implement GitOps with repo commits and pulls between branches, managing the deployment of resources through Validation and Staging environments before manual release pushes it to production. This helps to mitigate the risk of unintentional incidents.</li> -->

                <h4>DevOps Manager</h4>
                <p>
                    As the key decision maker for all aspects in improving the CI/CD side of the business, I am responsible for determining the scope and prioritization of tasks, while ensuring that all activities are compliant with relevant regulations and industry standards (PCI). This requires a deep understanding of technical requirements as well as business objectives, and the ability to balance competing demands and identify areas for improvement. Whether it is developing and implementing sales strategies, hiring and training staff, providing ongoing support to clients, or developing automation solutions, I take a strategic approach to every task, leveraging my knowledge and experience to drive results.

                <ul style="color:#888">
                    <li>Over the first two months, paid down six months of backlog tasks that had crippled the team's agility and worked to get self-service solutions put in place, with documentation to enable teams to resolve issues within teams rather than depending on the DevOps team to assist each developer with each question they had about their team's products.</li>
		            <li>Build a foundation of resources and tooling to enable automated deployments across the uncoordinated variety of environments and methods in use, in order to bring them into a standardized, cohesive workflow.</li>
                    <li>Build and manage a high-performing team of engineers, providing ongoing mentorship and skill development opportunities to promote personal and professional growth, while driving increased productivity and operational efficiency. Manage 1:1s, optomize team tasks to individual strengths, and pair team members for cross-training to improve individual skill gaps and increase team cohesion.</li>
                    <li>Work with Dev teams to design and implement CI/CD pipelines to automate artifact build/test/deployment through the SDLC eventually to client environments, expanding monthly deployment windows to at will deployments.</li>
                    <li>Create copious documentation: Presentations to onboard solutions to Dev team workflows, documentation to maintain, and learn more about their new tools. Write proposals for new work efforts, including terraform, automated post deployment validation testing, as well as AI efforts like outlined below.</li>
		    <li>Introduced NLP automation team to ChatGPT API functionality, along with other recent advances, such as creating reports on possibilities with Vector Databases, data collection and fine-tuning models for our needs, self-training systems (like Voyager), API focused models (like Gorilla), building unit testing into the pipeline to validate changes and score effectiveness. By combining store sales data, data about events like weather and promotions, operators could enjoy new insights easily queriable through normal question and answering to derive valuable new insights for their busienss.</li>

    <h3>Exploring AI, Learning, Exploration, Adoption, </h3>

    <h4>Introduction: Continuous Learning and Experimentation</h4>
    <p>Even before AI took center stage in the technological world with the success of ChatGPT and GPT-4, I sensed its incredible potential. With the initial lock down I started watching courses on machine learning as a side interest, exploring uses, news and developments. Intrigued at Natural Language Processing and embeddings, I embarked on a path of exploration, to understanding how these tools work and can be used, from the baser levels to better inform how to strategically leverage these sub-components in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE">emergent</a> systems.</p>

    <h4>A. Early Engagement with OpenAI's API (7'21)</h4>
    <p>I've been an early adopter and avid user of OpenAI's API since July 2021. This initial exploration wasn't without its challenges, as my months of high GPT-4 API costs attest. However, those obstacles only fueled my curiosity and ambition.</p>

    <h4>B. Building Custom Hardware: A Journey into Systems Engineering</h4>
    <p>Recognizing the need for hands-on experimentation, I designed and constructed a high-end computer system, purpose-built for running a wide variety of generative models and systems locally. This wasn't merely an exercise in hardware engineering, but a testament to my resource management skills, creating a custom solution tailored to the needs of cutting-edge AI research.</p>

    <h4>C. Hybrid Cloud Computing: Azure ARC Kubernetes Cluster</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leverage Azure Machine Learning:</strong> Harnessing Azure's capabilities to enhance my experiments, while offsetting my compute costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Trigger Orchestrated Task Execution:</strong> Utilizing triggered runbook to streamline workflows, leveraging my DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure Automation experience to automate needs from scheduled tasks to potentially facilitating autonomous-agent triggered tooling.</li>
        <li><strong>Adopt 'Cattle over Pet' Resource Philosophy:</strong> Emphasizing rapid node recovery and flexible resource allocation, reformatting the local system to prepare for or recover from experiments should be simple. It should be as easy as connecting to Azure Arc and letting the machine be retooled and brought back to Desired State.Implementing 'Configuration as Code' with Azure Arc for efficient systems management.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilize Terraform-enabled Kubernetes Management:</strong> Implementing 'Configuration as Code' with Azure Arc Kubernetes for efficient systems management and Desired state management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Conclusion: A Commitment to Innovation and Continuous Learning</h4>
    <p>My journey with AI has been one of continuous learning, adaptation, and innovation. From my early days exploring Generative NLP to building custom hardware and planning advanced hybrid-cloud solutions, I've not only followed the AI wave but actively experimented and learned with it. By melding diverse areas of knowledge and problem-solving, I've cultivated the skills to design and implement solutions that push the boundaries of technology while also planning for scalable and secure considerations. My approach transcends conventional thinking, reflecting a passion for discovery, a mastery of complex systems, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>

                    <h3>RPG Game Story Generator</h3>
                    <p>
                        This temporarily shelved project is a GPT-4 API empowered Python Runbook I built to help explore synthetically generating Starfinder adventures. I've built out a number of features and plan to build it out to include image and map generation as well as generating out full chatbot personalities to boot up into the scenario, enabling me to take on rich and complex characters by getting suggested dialogue feedback to inform my responses. I'll be returning to this project once I have a pipeline to easily create fine-tunings for this purpose.
