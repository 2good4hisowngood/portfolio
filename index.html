                        As an Azure Architect with a focus on security, I am currently working towards my Master's degree in Information Security and Assurance through Embry-Riddle. I am constantly seeking new knowledge and opportunities to grow my skills.

                        Some notable achievements include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tasked with designing and implementing a managed cloud hosting platform for a legacy desktop application whose existing deployment process required coordination between several people, poor or non-existent documentation, and decoupled but dependent configuration, I designed and built automation pipelines with terraform, packer, and powershell to allow a single engineer to deploy all components seamlessly, reducing a process that often times took weeks down to hours.</li>
                        <li>Ensured NIST 800-53 compliance by designing the requirements into the infrastructure as code, ensuring that all security controls were implemented and enforced throughout the infrastructure at the moment of deployment. </li>
                        <li>Oversaw a cloud engineering team, including recruitment, project management, professional development, and performance reviews, to ensure successful execution of projects and growth of team members.</li>
                        <!-- <li>Implementing deployments using Terraform, with over 150 resources ranging from VMs to configurations, backups, and DR failover configurations.</li>
                        <li>Optimizing storage and customizing deployments using a parameterized builder repository, and ensuring state drift is accounted for through regular reapplications of the deployment to re-establish the desired state.</li>
                        <li>Using Packer to build VM images for Terraform, ensuring that updates are current and adjustments to the base image are easy to make and distribute to clients without any availability impact.</li>
                        <li>Implementing PowerShell DSC pipelines to take raw .ps1 configuration files, compile, package, sign, audit, and publish Guest Configurations on commit to the repository. These configurations are audited and reapplied every 15 minutes if needed.</li>
                        <li>Utilizing GitHub Actions and Octopus Deploy to implement GitOps with repo commits and pulls between branches, managing the deployment of resources through Validation and Staging environments before manual release pushes it to production. This helps to mitigate the risk of unintentional incidents.</li> -->
